Title: Longest Subarray With Zero Sum

Given an array arr[] consisting of both positive and negative integers, find the length of the longest subarray whose elements sum is zero.
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array, formed by selecting one or more consecutive elements while maintaining their original order.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [15, -2, 2, -8, 1, 7, 10]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest subarray with sum equals to 0 is [-2, 2, -8, 1, 7].

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no subarray with 0 sum.

Input:  arr[] = [1, 0, 3]
Output:  1
Explanation: The longest sub-array with sum equal to 0 is [0].
